# Rise of Kingdoms account changer
This is a little personal script i wrote to help me swap accounts in PC version in a fast way. Need to run as admin or game wont be closed, and adjust the game folder path.

# How to save profiles
With the game closed, go to the game path. Rename the folder "save" for "save - (acctname)". Launch the game again to login to another account, which will generate a new save folder. Repeat
